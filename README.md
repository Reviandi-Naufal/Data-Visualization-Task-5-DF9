# Data-Visualization-Task-5-DF9

I have made a dashboard in Looker Studio (Previously Google Data Studio) using Newyork Yellow Taxi Feb 2019 Dataset. This dashboard shows you the total revenue, average distance per trip, graph that shows each number of transaction done by what types of payment, and top 10 pick up location. You can filter the chart by date and payment.<br>

Here is link to this [dashboard] (https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/9aee3ccb-0cd6-4852-908c-7d135c28133a/page/KioID/edit).<br>
